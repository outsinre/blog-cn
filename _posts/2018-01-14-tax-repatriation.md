title: 特狼仆减税
---

特狼仆最近减税，想拉回跨国公司被“困”在国外的利润。可“事实是检验真理的唯一标准”，这招数很早就用过了，最近一次是2004年：

The failed 2004 repatriation tax holiday led to large repatriations but not to new investment or jobs, and there’s little reason to think repatriated profits would have a different impact today. In 2004, lawmakers allowed multinationals to repatriate more than $300 billion in profits at a greatly reduced tax rate. But independent studies largely conclude that firms used those profits to pay cash to shareholders, not to invest or create U.S. jobs. In fact, many firms laid off large numbers of U.S. workers even while reaping multi-billion-dollar tax cuts. Today, offshore profits are concentrated in a few large multinationals that have recently made record cash payouts to shareholders by buying back stock, showing that they already have enough cash on hand to make whatever investments they project would be profitable. Repatriated profits would likely similarly be paid out to shareholders, not invested.

俗话说，上有政策，下有对策。大公司把剪掉的税款直接发给董事会成员了，没有创造一个“饭碗”或“增长”。全球化条件下，钱放离岸国家和放国内没什么区别，特狼仆的愿望要落空了。

根本原因还是“资本家逐利”，哪有什么“大义”。凡是不符合利润最大化的东西，都要避免嘛。我们也不能说人家错了。天天在演讲台上打太极拳、讲故事的某人就是这样忽悠粉丝掏钱的。一句话说来就是，理想中的美国既要吃肉又不让人喝汤，那是不可能的。可资本家懂得这个道理啊。

要解决这个问题，特狼仆应该对资本家来“硬”的，可自己就是个大资本家，更是被众资本家抬进白宫地，能怎地？也许我们都“图样突破森”了，特狼仆减税就是为了“报恩”。

再回头看看我国的一些大佬们，哎，由不得人心急如焚：）
